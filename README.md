Author: AndroxxTraxxon
This project is using Unity 5.1 and Visual Studio. 
The algoritms are in C#. 
If you want a demo, the best thus far is the PathfindingTest.unity under the Assets/_Scenes folder.
Basic in-game controls:
{
  left click to select the green ball
  click and drag for multiple select
  double click to select all units of the same unitID
  right click to send a unit to another location.
  
}

modify the unwalkable regions by duplicating the red cubes.
modify the path/grass region by adding gameobjects in those respective layers
